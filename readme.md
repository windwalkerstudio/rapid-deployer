# Rapid Deployer

Hi fam, 
Here we've developed a repository manager for windows users

You can also help me with completeing the api repository at [discord](https://discord.gg/mYrhYW6Dre)



# Note

1. This application is open [source](https://github.com/windwalkerstudio/source/tree/main/rapideploy-client)
2. All of the services and apps that can be downloaded via this app are not mine because this is just a third party app to download the resources provided by them


# How to use
Open cmd terminal after downloading **rpd.exe** and type:
```
rpd update
```
Then you can deploy your package by mentioning the category and version
You can find those on [rapid deployer api](https://github.com/windwalkerstudio/rapideploy-api)
```
rpd install <category> <version>
```

Then it will be deployed in the same directory as **rpd.exe**

and thats it
